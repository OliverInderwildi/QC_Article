Even before</p><p>becoming fully operational, its mere potential is already reshaping geopolitics, in</p><p>ß</p><p>uencing</p><p>economic strategy, and intensifying global rivalries. This article connects how this</p><p>technological quantum leap is driving power shifts, deepening con</p><p>ß</p><p>icts, and redrawing the</p><p>map of the 21st century.</p><p>Intro</p><p>We are living in an era of technological advancements hitherto unseen: arti</p><p>Þ</p><p>cial intelligence</p><p>(AI) is installed on almost every smartphone, our data</p><p>ß</p><p>oats in a gigantic virtual cloud,</p><p>Þ</p><p>nancial</p><p>assets are stored in novel, digital currencies and the list goes on and on.</p><p>Recently, signi</p><p>Þ</p><p>cant breakthroughs have been made with a technology that will be an</p><p>absolute game changer Ð quantum computing!</p><p>The</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst running quantum computer will mark* an in</p><p>ß</p><p>ection point as we will enter the era of</p><p>quantum supremacy</p><p>; an era in which we can calculate problems that were previously</p><p>1</p><p>beyond reach Ñ just as the invention of the telescope allowed us to observe galaxies we</p><p>didnÕt even know existed, or the microscope revealed entire worlds within a drop of water.</p><p>Used wisely, this technology will help us solve humanity's most pressing problems - as I</p><p>argued in Part 1 of this article. However, there is a potentially dark side to these</p><p>developments, as the power of the technology will upset global economic, political, military</p><p>and social balances. The unfathomable computational strength of QCs will shift geopolitical</p><p>power towards entities (yes, entities not necessarily nation states!) with access to QCs.</p><p>This</p><p>2</p><p>will create risks that may be impossible to control as weÕll lear n later in this think piece.</p><p>ÒWe are at an in</p><p>ß</p><p>ection point entering an era of technological supremacy, where entities that</p><p>lead in innovation and have access to the most advanced technologies will set the rules for</p><p>the future.Ó</p><p>this term was coined by John Preskill and popularised by Michiko Kaku but dates back to the</p><p>1</p><p>proposal of quantum computing by Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman.</p><p>I am deliberately using the simple future in this article as I deem it a question of time for QCs</p><p>2</p><p>entering the tech landscape.</p><p>Almost all new tech can be used bene</p><p>Þ</p><p>cially or maliciously,</p><p>think of nuclear technology and</p><p>the scientist of the Manhattan project (cross-ref. Manhattan project article): They</p><p>debated the</p><p>implications of the technology they were building long before it was operational. For QC the</p><p>same level of proactive ethical foresight is needed Ð and it is needed right now!</p><p>The second part of this article will examine these emerging risks, explore their geopolitical,</p><p>social and economic implications and assess how this not-yet-operational technology is</p><p>already affecting inter national affairs. Last but not least, weÕll explore what safeguards, if any,</p><p>we can still put in place to mitigate risks.</p><p>Quantum Computing: Power, Peril, and the Coming</p><p>Symbiosis with AI</p><p>Quantum computing wonÕt just be a technological upgrade Ñ it will mark a decisive point: A</p><p>new era will begin the moment the</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst operational QC becomes a reality. It will offer</p><p>computational power beyond anything we can currently comprehend. What we do with that</p><p>power could shape the fate of our planet Ð for better or for worse.</p><p>QCs could become humanityÕs ultimate problem-solving engine. They promise breakthroughs</p><p>in climate modelling, energy system optimisation, and disease prevention Ñ enabling us to</p><p>unravel some of the most stubbor n and complex challenges we face today. Part 1 of this</p><p>article addressed this in detail.</p><p>But thereÕs a darker side to that power. It stems largely from two extraordinary capabilities of</p><p>QCs: quantum decryption and quantum simulation. Each unlocks of these unprecedented</p><p>potential Ñ and peril Ñ across multiple domains:</p><p>¥</p><p>Quantum Decryption: A quantum computer can crack todayÕs encryption with ease,</p><p>rendering our current cryptographic safeguards obsolete. This threatens every sector that</p><p>relies on secure data Ñ banking, healthcare, communications, and national security. In</p><p>practical terms, a suf</p><p>Þ</p><p>ciently advanced QC could decrypt</p><p>Þ</p><p>nancial networks or manipulate</p><p>transactions at will. ThatÕs not just a technical failure Ñ itÕs a recipe for</p><p>Þ</p><p>nancial panic,</p><p>collapse of trust, and social upheaval.</p><p>¥</p><p>Quantum Simulations: QCs will be able to model highly complex, multidimensional</p><p>systems that classical computers simply canÕt handle. ThatÕs a good thing Ñ until itÕs not.</p><p>Quantum simulations could rapidly accelerate discoveries in sensitive</p><p>Þ</p><p>elds like</p><p>biotechnology or nanotech, pushing breakthroughs faster than society can regulate or</p><p>absorb. Some experts believe these advances could become existential threats Ñ for</p><p>instance, by enabling the design of autonomous weapons or engineered pathogens</p><p>before any oversight is possible.</p><p>Whoever reaches quantum supremacy</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst will likely reach quantum dominance soon after.</p><p>That actor Ñ whether a state or non-state entity Ñ will gain a decisive advantage across</p><p>science, defence,</p><p>Þ</p><p>nance, and global gover nance. Quantum supremacy might just determine</p><p>the next global hegemon.</p><p>GoogleÕs recent W illow breakthrough Ñ reducing computation times from 10 septillion years</p><p>to minutes Ñ has supercharged this global race. Microsoft quickly followed with claims of a</p><p>new quantum state of matter, only to be challenged in Nature. One thing is clear: the pace of</p><p>discovery is accelerating. And itÕs no coincidence. AI is now playing a major role in supporting</p><p>quantum development.</p><p>The animation below illustrates this emerging symbiosis between quantum computing and</p><p>arti</p><p>Þ</p><p>cial intelligence Ñ and what it means for the speed of progress ahead.</p><p>[Insert Infographic]</p><p>As shown in the infographic, AI is already supporting QC by assisting its operation and</p><p>design. Ultimately, this wonÕt remain a one-way street: once QCs are fully operational, they</p><p>will accelerate AI development in retur n, while providing it with unprecedented computational</p><p>power. A symbiosis that will lead to an ever-accelerating innovation cycle Ñ one increasingly</p><p>dif</p><p>Þ</p><p>cult for humans to gover n.</p><p>As we approach this threshold, we must be clear-eyed: quantum computing will usher in</p><p>extraordinary opportunity Ñ but also serious, immediate, and interlinked risks. ItÕs time we</p><p>looked at those risks in more detail.</p><p>Quantum ComputingÕs Severe Risks: Systemic and</p><p>Interdependent</p><p>The sci-</p><p>Þ</p><p>technology not only comes with the outlined severe risks for both our shared socio-</p><p>economic system and our very existence, but also with systemic impact. The risks however,</p><p>are not posed by the computer itself but by the controlling entity and cascades of events that</p><p>could be triggered if the power of QCs is not used responsibly. The visual risk matrix</p><p>illustrates that a plethora of events could be initiated that could lead to adverse outcomes;</p><p>these example risks are not exhaustive Ð they highlight how quantum technology, if misused</p><p>or unleashed without safeguards, could upend society or even jeopardise our existence. In</p><p>the risk matrix, hover over the outer layer depicting the potential result of QC misuse to see</p><p>which QC capability - simulations or decryption Ð  is the cause (1), which domain is impacted</p><p>(2) and the result (3) including links for further reading; the buttons in the top left-hand cor ner</p><p>allow you to explore socio-economic and existential risks separately.</p><p>(insert matrix here)</p><p>Notably, these threats are often synergetic, meaning they can amplify one another. The risk</p><p>matrixÕs scenarios donÕt occur in isolation Ð they interact and cascade. For instance, a</p><p>quantum-enabled attack that decrypts and collapses the</p><p>Þ</p><p>nancial system would inevitably</p><p>trigger broader economic crisis, which potentially leads to social upheaval. Such a scenario is</p><p>subsequently likely to cause a political crisis, which would affect the workings of society itself.</p><p>Likewise, rapid quantum-driven advances in AI or biotechnology could emerge just as</p><p>institutions are weakened by economic chaos, making the overall fallout even harder to</p><p>contain. In combination, one risk can feed into another, creating a vicious cycle of</p><p>compounding crises. In short, not only do QCs pose serious risks, but the mechanisms</p><p>behind the risks are interdependent and could - through cascade effects - create runaway</p><p>scenarios that we may not be able to control!</p><p>These risks are not theoretical Ñ they are driving geopolitical action in real time. The race to</p><p>develop the</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst operable quantum computer is already fuelling a full-blown global technology</p><p>war, most visibly between the U.S. and China. Quantum supremacy promises dominance not</p><p>just in computation, but in</p><p>Þ</p><p>nance, defence, and data Ñ the pillars of moder n power. This</p><p>has led to geopolitical tensions and an escalating cycle of techno-strategic rivalry. The</p><p>symbiosis between quantum computing and AI has only raised the stakes further Ñ the two</p><p>technologies amplify one another, raising both opportunity and risk. Owing to these high</p><p>stakes, quantum computing has become the epicentre of a moder n Cold War Ð a full-blown</p><p>tech race between China and the United States. ItÕs no longer about catching up; itÕs about</p><p>who can leap ahead fastest</p><p>.</p><p>3</p><p>Back-Up: Academia vs Public ÒWhile the scienti</p><p>Þ</p><p>c literature provides a broad overview of</p><p>quantum computing risks, reports from think tanks, NGOs, and gover nmental bodies place a</p><p>stronger emphasis on immediate cybersecurity threats, particularly concer ning data encryption</p><p>and</p><p>Þ</p><p>nancial system vulnerabilities. These organizations advocate for proactive measures,</p><p>including the adoption of quantum-resistant cryptographic standards and inter national</p><p>collaboration, to mitigate potential risks.</p><p>!</p><p>This focus suggests a heightened concer n within policy and strategic circles about the near-term</p><p>implications of quantum advancements on data security and</p><p>Þ</p><p>nancial stability.Ó</p><p>!</p><p>Technology &amp; Geopolitics: The Quantum Arms Race</p><p>!</p><p>Quantum computing is clearly a frontier technology: Building a functional QC requires</p><p>some of the most</p><p>Þ</p><p>ne-tuned physical conditions known to science: near absolute-zero</p><p>temperatures, ultra-high vacuum environments, and near-per fect isolationÉÉ and thatÕs</p><p>just the hardware. Equally critical are advanced semiconductors and control systems,</p><p>prerequisites for the sophisticated AI that enables the quantum chip to operate, i.e. to</p><p>remain in coherence. The quantum chip requires strategic chemical elements Ð more on</p><p>this later Ð and Ð rather unsurprisingly Ñ serious</p><p>Þ</p><p>nancial assets. Due to the high stakes</p><p>around QCs, gover nments are investing heavily in it: The heatmap below shows how</p><p>nations, unions and federations around the world are stepping up, funnelling billions into</p><p>the race for quantum supremacy. Some rely mainly on their private sector as well as</p><p>public-private par tnerships (PPPs), like the United States; some mainly on centralised</p><p>The Economist, Ò</p><p>Chinese AI is catching up, posing a dilemma for Donald Trump</p><p>Ó, January 2025;</p><p>3</p><p>Foreign Policy, Ò</p><p>What DeepSeek Revealed About the Future of U.S.-China Competition</p><p>Ó, January</p><p>2024 ; Foreign A</p><p>"</p><p>airs "</p><p>How AmericaÕs War on Chinese Tech Back</p><p>Þ</p><p>red</p><p>Ó, November 2024</p><p>investments, as for instance China or use a multi-faceted approach of like European</p><p>countries that utilise national and EU-wide investment, research programmes, star t-up</p><p>suppor t as well as PPPs. When it comes to the main direct competitors, the</p><p>US has the</p><p>advantage of larger private sector investments and a decentralised, highly-collaborative</p><p>environment of corporates, research institutions and leading universities.</p><p>The race for quantum computing is the moder n-day analogue to the nuclear ar ms race of</p><p>the 20th centur y Ñ only this time, the battleground is shifting from raw militar y power and</p><p>territorial control to technological supremacy. Markus P</p><p>ß</p><p>itsch, CEO of Terra Quantum and</p><p>advisor to President Trump, has aptly dubbed this new arena Ò</p><p>techno-politics</p><p>Ó. Yet as</p><p>weÕll see next, control over critical resources remains a decisive factor in this escalating</p><p>contest.</p><p>The battle, however, is not exclusively fought with proactive measure to suppor t QC</p><p>progress, there is a</p><p>ß</p><p>ip side: next to suppor ting the development of the technology,</p><p>players are looking for means to prohibit others from achieving quantum supremacy</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst.</p><p>Interestingly, these effor ts are key factors in ongoing con</p><p>ß</p><p>icts and geopolitical tensions</p><p>that we follow through the media without realising that they are linked to technological</p><p>endeavours. DonÕt despair, IÕll tie it all together later in this ar ticle.</p><p>Breaking the Cycle: Chips on the Global Table</p><p>While a plethora of high-tech equipment is necessar y to run a QC, the real strategic</p><p>Achilles heal in this race is the supply of advanced semiconductors. Quantum computers</p><p>depend on sophisticated control systems, which in tur n require the most advanced</p><p>semiconductors; the infographic on the QC-AI symbiosis in the preceding section (link)</p><p>illustrated this.</p><p>These semiconductors are produced mainly in countries af</p><p>Þ</p><p>liated with the West, and the</p><p>WestÕs plan is to achieve quantum supremacy</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst not only by pushing the technology,</p><p>but also by prohibiting China access to the mentioned chips. Ultimately, itÕs precisely the</p><p>symbiosis between AI and QC, the vir tuous circle shown in the preceding section, that</p><p>rival nations are tr ying to disrupt; see the animation below.</p><p>To prevent China from gaining the upper hand, the US has imposed sweeping trade</p><p>restrictions, targeting not just Chinese companies but the global semiconductor supply</p><p>chain. These sanctions aim to slow ChinaÕs access to high-end chips Ð and by extension,</p><p>to the advanced quantum and AI systems that depend on them. Initial sanction have</p><p>been implemented during the</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst Trump presidency and were tightened several times</p><p>since. The animation below shows semiconductor expor ts Ð from basic to advanced Ð</p><p>from the US to China, and illustrates that only the most recent restriction have had an</p><p>impact, as earlier versions could be circumvented. Meanwhile, other countries have</p><p>joined the allegiance to control access to state-of-the-ar t chips; Japan, Taiwan, the</p><p>Netherlands and many other countries have joined this allegiance</p><p>.</p><p>4</p><p>The sanctions, however, had a fair few unintended consequences such as spurring</p><p>ChinaÕs domestic endeavours for advanced chip manufacturing, the hoarding of chips</p><p>and equipment or the establishment of back-channel supply chains. In addition, the</p><p>restrictions are obviously hampering innovation by disrupting the global innovation eco-</p><p>system; since countries that are not clearly af</p><p>Þ</p><p>liated with the West are included in expor t</p><p>restrictions, innovations from their end are hampered leading to a slowdown of</p><p>development</p><p>. The most impor tant &amp; detrimental knock-on effect, however, is the</p><p>5</p><p>resurgence of an old con</p><p>ß</p><p>ict in East Asia:</p><p>ChinaÕs territorial ambitions regarding Taiwan!</p><p>CSIS"</p><p>Understanding U.S. AlliesÕ Current Legal Authority to Implement AI and Semiconductor</p><p>4</p><p>Export Controls</p><p>", March 2025</p><p>Adrain Monck in Arab News, Ò</p><p>The Gulf Õs advantage in the next AI chapter</p><p>Ó, January 2025</p><p>5</p><p>The Straight of Taiwan has become a geopolitical</p><p>ß</p><p>ashpoint again: TaiwanÕs</p><p>semiconductor foundries (especially TSMC) are among the few capable of producing the</p><p>chips needed to control next-gen QCs. In strategic ter ms, this makes Taiwan not just a</p><p>territorial prize, but a technological one Ñ protected, for now, by whatÕs often referred to</p><p>as the Silicon Shield. Should China lay its hands on the Island nation, the West Ð led by</p><p>the United States Ð would clearly intervene, hence TaiwanÕs capabilities in silicon chip</p><p>manufacturing are attraction and deterrent at the same time, providing Taiwan with its</p><p>Silicon Shield.</p><p>The recent happenings in the Straight of Taiwan clearly show that both sides are</p><p>ß</p><p>exing</p><p>muscles. China is continuing militar y drills, most recently resembling a blockade of the</p><p>Island, while Wester n countries are sending naval forces to indicate their likely response.</p><p>From this it can be seen that the stakes in this race are ver y, ver y high</p><p>https://x.com/Reuters/status/1907037729378185434</p><p>But China doesn't stand there empty-handed; it controls another vital ingredient for high</p><p>tech, and it didn't take long for China to use it in retaliation. Let's take a closer look at this</p><p>below.</p><p>!</p><p>ChinaÕs Tit-forTat: Critical Mineral Resources</p><p>High-tech is a lot about know-how, but not exclusively; some chemical elements are</p><p>irreplaceable in the manufacturing of advanced systems such as platinum for</p><p>catalysis or neodymium for state-of-the-art magnets. A group of chemical elements</p><p>referred to as rare earth metals (REMs) are critical for a range of important tech</p><p>developments including electric engines, LED lights,</p><p>Þ</p><p>bre-optic cables and state-of-</p><p>the-art magnets.</p><p>In defense, REMs are used in satellite communications, guidance systems, and</p><p>aircraft structures.  The U.S. Department of Defense has highlighted the importance</p><p>of securing a stable supply of these materials, noting their use in critical defence</p><p>capabilities such as the F-35 Lightning II aircraft and advanced radar systems</p><p>.</p><p>6</p><p>In addition to these important applications, REMs are critical for  Ð you guessed it  Ð</p><p>quantum chips.</p><p>Currently, the main producer of these elements is China and it did not wait long to use</p><p>its control over this resource to retaliate the USÕ export bans with an analogue for</p><p>REMs</p><p>.</p><p>In December 2023, China banned the export of technology related to rare</p><p>7</p><p>earth magnet production, adding to existing restrictions on extraction and separation</p><p>technologies. These measures underscore ChinaÕs intent to maintain its dominance in</p><p>the rare earth sector, as it accounts for nearly 90% of global re</p><p>Þ</p><p>ned output</p><p>.</p><p>This</p><p>8</p><p>strategic move underscores the pivotal role REMs play not only in quantum</p><p>computing but also across a spectrum of high-tech applications, including defence</p><p>systems</p><p>.</p><p>9</p><p>ChinaÕs export controls on REMs have prompted other nations to seek alter native</p><p>sources and reduce reliance on Chinese supplies. For example, the European Union</p><p>has announced strategic projects to increase production of critical materials within</p><p>member countries as part of ERMA, the European Raw Materials Alliance</p><p>.  Equally,</p><p>10</p><p>the United States are exploring domestic resources, such as the Round Top Mountain</p><p>in Texas, which hosts signi</p><p>Þ</p><p>cant deposits of heavy rare-earth elements</p><p>.</p><p>11</p><p>The geopolitical manoeuvring surrounding REMs highlights their strategic importance</p><p>in the global technology landscape.

The key here is the</p><p>geographical distribution of REMs and how this distribution overlaps with political</p><p>allegiances, the infographic below explains this, please click yourself through it.</p><p>From the above infographic you can see that REMs are concentrated in a few</p><p>countries and the lionÕs share of REMs are in countries with a</p><p>BRICS</p><p>af</p><p>Þ</p><p>liation!</p><p>Hence, the WestÕs access is limited and the global contest for REMs has intensi</p><p>Þ</p><p>ed</p><p>through the advent of quantum computing, with geopolitical tensions in</p><p>ß</p><p>uencing</p><p>strategic manoeuvres. From the infographic, you clearly recognised two countries that</p><p>have been in the media quite a lot lately: Ukraine and Greenland. LetÕs look at their</p><p>relevancy below.</p><p>In the midst of the Ukraine con</p><p>ß</p><p>ict, President Donald Trump, shortly after taking of</p><p>Þ</p><p>ce,</p><p>demanded compensation from Ukraine for the extensive military aid the US had</p><p>provided to the attacked country. "Surprisingly", this compensation was to be paid in</p><p>the form of an agreement on critical minerals, including - you guessed it again - rare</p><p>earth metals.The Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is willing to agree on such</p><p>an arrangement but insists on tying it to security guarantees for his country, while his</p><p>US counterpart is reluctant and is pressuring Ukraine. WeÕre not in checkmate, but</p><p>de</p><p>Þ</p><p>nitely in check.  President Selensky has - in my opinion quite rightly Ð tur ned</p><p>TrumpÕs deal down as it did not come with security guarantees; he owes it to the</p><p>Ukrainian people to make the most of the countries resources and use them as a</p><p>shield analogue to TaiwanÕs silicon shield. An indirect safeguard for Ukraine, however,</p><p>would be American Òboots on the groundÓ in form of US mining giants exploring</p><p>resources in Ukraine Ð I bet Russia would think twice or trice about bombing Ukraine if</p><p>this would interfere with US business operations regarding strategic resources. At the</p><p>time of writing, negotiations are still on going.</p><p>Concurrently, Trump has renewed his interest in acquiring Greenland, citing its vast</p><p>reserves of rare earth elements and it strategic location for entrance into the Atlantic</p><p>ocean as vital for U.S. national security. These developments underscore the</p><p>escalating global scramble for REMs, driven by their indispensable role in high-tech</p><p>industries and defence applications. Let me be clear: these con</p><p>ß</p><p>icts and tensions are</p><p>not predominantly about REMs, but the scramble for these critical resources and</p><p>technological supremacy is a key factor fuelling them!</p><p>Moreover, the above explained examples show that - behind Trump's bold and</p><p>populist rhetoric - there are strategic goals aimed at cementing the US's position as a</p><p>technological and military leader, as well as re-establishing the US as a global</p><p>economic powerhouse. The economy is another factor driving interest in QC; in the</p><p>following sections, we'll explore what experts think about the potential for positive</p><p>economic impact that QC can provide.</p><p>The Economic Promise of Quantum Computing</p><p>Still, the hype around QCs isnÕt just geopolitical, the economics of the tech look pretty</p><p>nice too. According to leading consultancies and market analysts, quantum computing</p><p>could generate between $450 billion and $2 trillion in economic value by 2035. ThatÕs not</p><p>just a futuristic vision Ñ itÕs a near-ter m transfor mation!</p><p>As visualised in the infographic below, estimates var y widely depending on how quickly</p><p>the technology matures and how broadly itÕs adopted. The Boston Consulting Group</p><p>provides a conservative range of $450Ð850 billion, while Quantum Insider and McKinsey</p><p>&amp; Company both project potential impacts approaching or exceeding $1 trillion. ThatÕs a</p><p>market larger than the entire global smar tphone ecosystem today.</p><p>But these forecasts donÕt only re</p><p>ß</p><p>ect the growth of hardware and software sales Ñ they</p><p>account for value creation across sectors: phar ma, logistics,</p><p>Þ</p><p>nance, energy, materials</p><p>science, and beyond. Quantum computing wonÕt just launch a new tech ver tical Ñ it will</p><p>upgrade existing ones.</p><p>In the shor t ter m, the market for quantum hardware and software alone is expected to hit</p><p>$8Ð15 billion by 2025, underscoring the urgency with which industr y leaders are building</p><p>quantum capacity. As the timeline narrows, the stakes rise Ñ not just for businesses and</p><p>investors, but for entire economies competing to capture the lionÕs share of this</p><p>transfor mative value.</p><p>The economic impact of quantum computing will also depend on how the technology Ð</p><p>and its symbiosis with AI Ð will be managed by gover nment. From the risk assessment, it</p><p>can be clearly seen that we cannot let this technologies Ògo looseÓ as there are too many</p><p>risks involved. Legislators will have to face the dif</p><p>Þ</p><p>cult balancing act of suppor ting this</p><p>innovation while safeguarding the public interest, an impor tant point that weÕll explore</p><p>together hereafter.</p><p>Precautions &amp; Safeguards: Can We Stay Ahead of the Curve?</p><p>While the quantum arms race accelerates, so too do efforts to mitigate its most dangerous</p><p>consequences. Gover nments, research institutions, and industry coalitions are scrambling to future-</p><p>proof digital systems and strategic infrastructure before quantum capabilities render them obsolete Ñ</p><p>or vulnerable. Hereafter a few examples:</p><p>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): The most urgent safeguard is building encryption that quantum</p><p>computers canÕt break. Known as post-quantum cryptography, or PQC, this new class of encryption</p><p>algorithms is designed to withstand attacks from quantum decryption. The U.S. National Institute of</p><p>Standards and Technology (NIST) is already leading the charge, selecting candidate algorithms for</p><p>global implementation. Several countries, including Germany, Canada, and Japan, are running parallel</p><p>efforts to ensure their critical infrastructure and digital assets can survive in a post-quantum world.</p><p>National Security Initiatives: Quantum tech is now a tier-one national security issue. Intelligence</p><p>agencies and military planners are actively assessing how future QCs could compromise classi</p><p>Þ</p><p>ed</p><p>communications, weapons systems, and power grids. In response, national initiatives are being</p><p>funded at scale to:</p><p>¥</p><p>Harden communications infrastructure with quantum-resistant protocols.</p><p>¥</p><p>Map vulnerabilities in existing systems under realistic quantum threat models.</p><p>¥</p><p>Prepare counterintelligence strategies to detect and deter hostile use of quantum capabilities.</p><p>Digital Diplomacy &amp; Strategic Alliances: Quantum security isnÕt just a technical challenge Ñ itÕs a</p><p>diplomatic one. Nations are beginning to formalise Òdigital diplomacyÓ frameworks: cross-border</p><p>agreements on tech standards, export controls, and joint research initiatives. The EU, U.S., and Japan</p><p>are leading the charge in forming such alliances, often tied to existing cybersecurity pacts or 6G</p><p>research partnerships. The Quad Alliance (U.S., India, Australia, Japan) has also discussed quantum</p><p>as a critical area of cooperation.</p><p>The tightrope regulators will have to walk between innovation and safeguards will be a formidable</p><p>challenge.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Quantum computing (QC) is more than a technological revolution Ñ itÕs an in</p><p>ß</p><p>ection point with the</p><p>power to reshape the global order. The</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst operational QC will not just mark a scienti</p><p>Þ</p><p>c milestone; it</p><p>will shift the balance of power on a geopolitical scale. Owing to this, a not-yet-operational technology</p><p>is already affecting inter national affairs.</p><p>Whoever develops the</p><p>Þ</p><p>rst scalable quantum computer Ñ whether a state, corporation, or other</p><p>entity Ñ will be able to shape the future of humanity. This entity will hold unprecedented in</p><p>ß</p><p>uence over</p><p>defence,</p><p>Þ</p><p>nance, science, and communication. In short: it will hold hegemony over the 21st century.</p><p>Given these monumental stakes, a full-blown tech war is underway Ñ and itÕs being fought with every</p><p>tool available: strategic investments, trade sanctions, supply chain disruptions, diplomatic alliances,</p><p>management of con</p><p>ß</p><p>icts and even covert operations.</p><p>This race is clearly high on former President Donald TrumpÕs radar. His public push to secure rare</p><p>earth supplies from sources outside China, his confrontational stance toward Chinese tech</p><p>dominance, and his appointment of key advisors from the QC and semiconductor sectors all point to</p><p>one thing: quantum supremacy is no longer just a tech goal Ñ itÕs a matter of national strategy.</p><p>Moreover, it also shows that thereÕs a new sheriff in town: Trump runs a quid-pro-quo approach in</p><p>foreign policy. You want the USÕ helps, you better have something to offer. Same goes for NATO, if</p><p>you want the US to remain a strong partner, you have to increase your defence spending to above the</p><p>negotiated 2% of GDP. Many have not done that, but rely on US support as for instance with the war</p><p>raging in Easter n Europe. A new world order is in the making!</p><p>As we race toward this new frontier, we must not forget: the very same technology that could help us</p><p>solve our most pressing global challenges could also deepen existing divides, destabilize institutions,</p><p>and spark con</p><p>ß</p><p>ict Ñ unless we build safeguards now.</p><p>Quantum computing may be inevitable. How we manage it is still a choice.</p></body></html>
